Amazing Player’s Strategy

First chooses strategy for getting another move
  Loops to see if any move will end in the player's pit

Then chooses because it captures seeds from the other side
  Loops to see if any move will end in an empty pit

Then chooses strategy to hurt other player
  Loops to see if any move will end in a pit that would have gotten the next player
  another move

Then chooses strategy to clear pits for stealing seeds
  Loops to find the pit closest to the player’s scoring pit that has at least one seed.

Using a test file I created, I tested all combinations of pits and seeds, and recorded the statistics for 1000 games on each combination
Although in each combination, the amazing player usually only won a little over half of the games, with some anomalies, on a large scale, amazing won the majority of the games
When seeded with the number 50, amazing wins 17009 games, strategy wins 8978 games, and they tie 4013 games
